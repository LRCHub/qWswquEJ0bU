Pick me, pick me yeah
Let along your signal
At ease, at least yeah
Everyone is hollow

At last, at last yeah
Everyone is playing
Pick me, pick me yeah
You can eat my mellon

Hey

Dive, dive, dive, dive in me
Dive, dive, dive, dive in me
Dive in me
Nothing new
Nothing new

Kiss this, kiss that yeah
Let along your signal
At least, at least yeah
I will even swallow

Pick me, pick me yeah
Let along your signal
At ease, at ease, yeah
You could eat my mellon

Hey

Dive, dive, dive, dive in me
Dive, dive, dive, dive in me
Dive in me, dive in me, dive in me
Dive in...

Dive, dive, dive, dive in me
Dive, dive, dive, dive in me
Dive, dive, dive, dive in me
Nothing new
Nothing new
Nothing new
Nothing new
Nothing new
Nothing new
Nothing new
