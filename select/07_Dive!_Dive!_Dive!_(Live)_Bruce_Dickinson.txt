Put an opening shot across your bows
Got tunnel vision, hmm, pull the sheets in now
Let 'em flap, oh let 'em rip
This man o' war gonna sink your ship
Gonna blow you midships
Gonna dive tonight
There's no release 'till you're deep down inside

Davy Jones gonna keep your bones
No monkee business now you're on your own
Turn your stern and cover me
We're rolling swell just an old seadog like me
Gonna blow you midships
Gonna dive tonight
There's no release when you're deep down inside

Dive! Dive! Dive!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
No muff too tuff
We dive at five

Seaman Staines is down below
Torpedoes loaded he's ready to go
Wait to discharge waiting to release
As she rounded the horn we came up from below
Gonna blow you midships
Gonna dive tonight
There's no release when you're deep down inside

Dive! Dive! Dive!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
Dive! Dive! Dive!
No muff too tuff
We dive at five

Come on, come on
Dive! Dive! Dive!
Yeah, Dive! Dive! Dive!
Come on, Dive! Dive! Dive!
No muff too tuff
We dive at five

Dive! Dive! Dive!
Sinking slow
Dive! Dive! Dive!
Sinking deep
Dive! Dive! Dive!
No muff too tuff
We dive at five

(Seaman Staines, consider yourself discharged)
